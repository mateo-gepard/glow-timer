Arduino code for a 3D printable time management gadget e.g. for pomodore technique
Meet the Glow-Timer, a 3D-printed, open-source project that brings together the simplicity of a timer with the fun of LED lights and interactive user experience. This device is not just a timer – it's a unique blend of utility, technology, and affordability.

At the core of the Glow-Timer lies a rotary encoder, powered by an Arduino Nano. This setup allows the user to set a timer by simply turning the transparent top part of the device. A 12-led RGB ring shows you the progression of time and keeps you focused.

Once the timer reaches its end, it alerts the user with visual and audio feedback.

The Glow-Timer is designed with a cylindrical 3D-printed casing. Its form factor is both compact and aesthetically pleasing, making it a great addition to any desk, kitchen, or workshop.

I could source all the parts for about $10, assembly was fairly easy, and the print time should not be more than 5–6 hours without supports. This is V1 thechnically V9 of V1 but the first good working prototype, so feedback is very welcome. I hope you like it! :)
